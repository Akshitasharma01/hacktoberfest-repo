# Hacktoberfest Repository for Algorithms

This is a repository for Hacktoberfest 2020. I will be contributing Data Structures and Algorithm problem solutions here, and would encourage the others to do the same. The focus should be on learning algorithms and not just copy pasting solutions from the internet.

### How to Contribute?

- Fork this repo by clicking on the Fork button on top right.

- Clone the repo to your system. 
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hacktoberfest-repo.git
  cd hacktoberfest-repo
  ```
- Make a new branch. Paste the below code snippet in your terminal. (Remove '<' and '>')
  
  ```
  git checkout -b <your-algorithm-name>
  ```
  
- Add a new algorithm in a separate folder. See contribution guidelines for more info.

- After making changes, push the code to your branch.
  
  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "message"
  git push origin <your-branch-name>
  ```
- Go to your branch and click on 'Compare and Pull Request' button. Add a description of the algorithm also.
  
### Contribution Guidelines:

- Commit message will be of format ```"Adding/modifying <algorithm-name>"```
- Do not push changes to master directly.
- Name the folder with the Algorithm's name. 
- Algorithms can be written in any language. It could be a Leetcode question, or a question from competitive programming contests.
- Please avoid adding algorithms already added by others.
  
### Happy Hacking!
