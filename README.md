# Hacktoberfest Repository for Algorithms

This is a repository for Hacktoberfest 2020. I will be contributing Data Structures and Algorithm problem solutions here, and would encourage the others to do the same.

# How to Contribute?

- Fork this repo by clicking on the Fork button on top right.

- Clone the repo to your system. 
  
  ```

  cd hacktoberfest-repo
  ```
- Make a new branch. Paste the below code snippet in your terminal. (Remove '<' and '>')
  
  ```
  git checkout -b <your-algorithm-name>
  ```
  
- Add a new algorithm in a separate folder. Name the folder with the Algorithm's name. Algorithms can be written in any language. It could be a Leetcode question, or a question from competitive programming contests. 

- After making changes, push the code.
  
  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "message"
  git push origin <your-branch-name>
