# Hacktoberfest Repository for Algorithms

This is a repository for Hacktoberfest 2020. I will be contributing Data Structures and Algorithm problem solutions here, and would encourage the others to do the same.

### How to Contribute?

- Fork this repo by clicking on the Fork button on top right.

- Clone the repo to your system. 
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/subhronilsaha/hacktoberfest-repo.git
  cd hacktoberfest-repo
  ```
- Make a new branch. Paste the below code snippet in your terminal. (Remove '<' and '>')
  
  ```
  git checkout -b <your-algorithm-name>
  ```
  
- Add a new algorithm in a separate folder. See contribution guidelines for more info.

- After making changes, push the code.
  
  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "message"
  git push origin <your-branch-name>
  ```
  
### Contribution Guidelines:

- Commit message will be of format ```"Adding/modifying <algorithm-name>"```
- Do not push changes to master directly.
- Name the folder with the Algorithm's name. 
- Algorithms can be written in any language. It could be a Leetcode question, or a question from competitive programming contests.
- Please avoid adding algorithms already added by others.
  
### Happy Hacking!
